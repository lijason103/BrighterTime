# BrighterTime
## Challenges
* 1. **Financial and economical challengs of accessing proper mental health treatment:** BrighterTime offers users free access to resources and mental health professionals (who may volunteer to use the application).
* 2. **Difficulty searching for and accessing resources:** The application allows users to search for trained professionals through Algolia.
* 3. **Peer support Connection:** The "Wall" feature of the app provides a space for the users to share their thoughts anonymously and express their gratitude.
* 4. **Simple machine training algorithm:** The text analysis algorithm can be trained to accurately determine a user's risk through various scenarios and evaluate the quality of their treatment.
* 5. **Messaging and text integration:** BrighterTime provides a messaging system for users to professionals and other users via text. 
* 6. **Detection of drug abuse behaviours:** The application presents the user with various scenarios and analyzes their input to detect drug related vocabulary.


## About

BrighterTime was inspired by LumoHacks’ topic of mental health issues in veterans and first responders. The app has multiple functionalities such as providing an anonymous, confidential, and therapeutic support group for people who are at risk of depression. It also consists of a “Wall” feature where the users can share their thoughts anonymously. Users can play games while answering a series of questions about real life situations which will be evaluated. BrighterTime incorporates machine learning to determine a user’s risk of depression based on their language and responses. High risk users are presented to a group of trained professionals who optionally reach out to the user via an emailing system.
