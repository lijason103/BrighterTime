# BrighterTime
## Challenges
* 1. **Financial and economical challengs of accessing proper mental health treatment:** BrighterTime offers users free access to resources and mental health professionals (who may volunteer to use the application).
* 2. **Difficulty searching for and accessing resources:** The application allows users to search for trained professionals through Algolia.
* 3. **Peer support Connection:** The "Wall" feature of the app provides a space for the users to share their thoughts anonymously and express their gratitude.
* 4. **Simple machine training algorithm:** The text analysis algorithm can be trained to accurately determine a user's risk through various scenarios and evaluate the quality of their treatment.
* 5. **Messaging and text integration:** BrighterTime provides a messaging system for users to professionals and other users via text. 
* 6. **Detection of drug abuse behaviours:** The application presents the user with various scenarios and analyzes their input to detect drug related vocabulary.


## About

This app was inspired by LumoHacks topic of mental health issues in veterans and first responders. 
BritherTime has multiple functionalities such as providing a 
support group for the people at risk of depression while
keeping it anonymous, confidential, and therapeutic. This app consits of a wall where the users can share their 
thoughts anonymously. The users can play a game, answer a series of questions about some real 
life situations and based on their answers, the app will analyze their risk of depression. This app uses 
machine learning to evaluate the language used in the user responses and rank them based on their risk of depression. 
The list of users with higher risk will be presented to a group of trained professionals where they 
can chose to reach out to the user via an emailing system.  


## Technical 
Front-end programming language: React Native 
Back-end: Python and SQLITE3

## Further Development 
* 1. A better ML algorithm can be used for text processing 
* 2. Further research is needed on evaluating accuracy of depression risk based on text phrases
* 3. Other evaluation games, scenraios can be added 
* 4. Counsellour and pyschologist search function can be added, database could be expanded based on area and a patient review system could be implemented  
* 5. Addition of depression based on voice evaluation
